                Green Heaven began as a small family nursery in Portland, Oregon, with a passion for plants and a dream to share the joy of gardening with everyone. What started as a weekend farmers' market stall quickly blossomed into a thriving online business as we saw the growing demand for quality plants delivered with care.
